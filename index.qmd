This project implements an interactive Bode plot generator, capable of displaying the amplitude and phase response of a device under test (DUT) such as an analog filter across a swept frequency range of 100Hz to 100kHz. This was implemented using an FPGA to generate sine waves via an internal DDS, and an MCU to receive and process the signal. Then, the data was from the MCU to an ESP8266, which serves a webpage for plotting the log-scale Bode plot.
